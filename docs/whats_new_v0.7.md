v0.7 (May 15, 2018)

deprecations, new features, enhancements, and performance improvements along 
with a large number of bug fixes.

Highlights include:

- Optionally use PySpark (beta)
- Bonobo ETL is now optional in installation
- OlaPy can run in browser with Pyodide
- Python 3.7 support
- Big Refactor and API cleanup
- Many bugs fixes


New features

* Optionally use PySpark (beta)

For its memory consumption, at a certain moment the use of pandas is no longer effective, 
so an alternative is to use Spark (PySpark) as data analysis tool,
OlaPy can now support Spark as data analysis tools instead of default tool which is pandas.

to use Spark with OlaPy:

    pip install olapy[spark]
    
and to go back to pandas, just uninstall spark:

    pip uninstall pyspark


* Bonobo ETL is now optional in installation

OlaPy v0.6 includes by default Bonobo ETL, starting from v0.7 Bonobo will be installed in option, to do so:

    pip install olapy[bonobo]

* OlaPy can run in browser with Pyodide

OlaPy can run inside your web browser as library (not XMLA server), 
thus all computations happens in the browser, with direct access to Web API technologies like the DOM.
how could this happens? well, thanks to iodide and pyodide projects which feature Python running entirely in the browser, 
allowing portable and reproducible data science using Python without having to install anything.
